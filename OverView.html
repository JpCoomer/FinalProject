<title>Final Project</title>

<h1>Proposal</h1>
<p>The project that I plan to do involves a more esoteric language. I plan to explore the SHAKESPEARE programming language. To do so I will program a simple (to play, not so simple to build.) text based role playing game with the language. Since this language is rather low level despite its use of mostly middle english. I will be doing this project by myself as I do not feel anyone else would be keen on studying such an obscure and relatively useless language.

I think that this will be a good exercise of the skills learned in class, as the language is much different in syntax than any other language that I’ve ever used. It also uses the goto command in its own way quite a lot which is not something I’m very used to doing outside of assembly. The language is supposed to read like a shakespearean play when it is done, so the flowery language of the rpg will be evident both in play and in the code. I think that is really neat, and that is why I’d like to do this project. I believe that language is about expressing oneself, and this is a creative way to do so demonstrating the artistic ability of programming languages; not just as a means to an end, but as an end to and of themselves.

<h2>Checkpoint 1</h2>
<p>I would link to what I did for checkpoint one here, but seeing as I didn't do it I cannot.</p>

<br>
<h3>CheckPoint 2</h3>
<p>Likewise, this checkpoint was also missed by me, because I was under the incorrect impression that we could submit for the checkpoints late, which turned out to be a false assumption. </p>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
My (solo) final project ended up having to be altered from the original. What I did not know about Shakespeare going in was the inefficiency of it and the manumental effort it took to get anything done compared to the languages I'm used to. Maybe I'm too used to higher level programming languages, but the idea of using the language to create a project sizable enough to be worth credit for a 300 level course on just the codes merit was far too daunting. I instead decided to shift my focus towards the Shakespeare language itself, and providing an analysis not unlike the ones done for our first presentations.

<h9>Integration of Course Material</h9>
<p>My research paper builds upon the language analysis done for our first presentation, and adds in elements from throughout the semester. It should be apparent when read. Things like scope, parsing, datatypes, sorts, stacks, exception handling, etc are all mentioned at least once. I attempted to analyse the language, not just with the tools needed for the first presentation, but also with all of the tools gained along the way through the completion of this course. </p>

<h10>Technical Complexity</h10>
<p>Learning a new programming language is difficult, but the added difficulty of this one is something that I was not expecting. I myself am not a frequent user of assembly or other low level languages, so I had a difficult time with the learning curve there. I think that I did a good job analyzing and researching the language with the resources available for it, as there haven't been many others to write about it. In fact, my paper is longer and more in depth than any of the resources I've been able to find for it besides the Sourceorge made for it by the original creator. I am happy with what I was able to accomplish given the circumstances, and think I integrated not only the original language analysis from the beginning of the course well, but also the topics covered throughout the semester. Shakespeare has some unique elements such as characters being the only variables and stacks as well that I had to take into account when researching the language. All in all It's 4 pages of pure writing ten if the code is included, not exactly a senior thesis, but for the scope of the class I believe it is a good final project/language analysis.</p>
